```{r}
#load data
iris<-iris
```

```{r}
#matrix of scatterplots
pairs(iris[, -5], col = iris[, 5], pch = 19)
```

```{r}
irispca<-princomp(iris[-5])
summary(irispca)
```
The variance of the data is seen in the cumulative proportion under each component. Thus, the first component can explain 92.4% of the variance and for each component after, more of the variance is explained.

```{r}
#extract factors in pca
irispca$loadings
```
